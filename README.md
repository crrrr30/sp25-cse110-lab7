**1)** Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
  1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
  2. Manually run them locally before pushing code
  3. Run them all after all development is completed

*Response.* I would choose **option 1**, running GitHub actions on push. More specifically, there will be `dev` and `main` branchesâ€”only on those branches would pushes trigger the action. 

In this way, I make sure:
- The actions aren't triggered too often: not every change demands a whole UI check, only important, larger changes that get merged into `dev` require checks.
- The process is automated: where the code's correctness matters (by merging into more critical branches), this can be automated as a "check" that prevents any further changes if anything goes wrong.

**2)** Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

*Response.* **No,** I would not use end-to-end tests to check if a function returns the correct output. Especially for smaller functions with clear expectations for its output that run independent of rendering, networking, state managemenent, etc., **unit tests** would best suit the scenario.
